# Solution Files
PLEXOS(R) solution files contain the results of PLEXOS simulations. Constructing reports 
based on these results is a common API activity.

The scripts herein use a combination of pandas, sqlite3, and the PLEXOS API to construct 
such reports and the extensibility to construct further reports.

#1. connect.py

Demonstrates connecting to a solution file and querying a set of results

#2. query_enums.py

Demonstrates listing out the possible values that each of the enumerations
related to solution queries can take. Useful for modifying 1.

#3. query_to_pandas.py and query_to_pandas_via_csv.py

Demonstrates querying results into a pandas dataframe. _via_csv is better for 
large volumes of data.

#4. query_to_sqlite3.py

Demonstrates pushing a solution query into a sqlite3 database.

For browsing SQLite3 data, you might want to install the DB Browser for SQLite.
http://sqlitebrowser.org/

#5. plotting_queries.py

Demonstrates using matplotlib to produce a plot of PLEXOS results.

#6. api_exploration.py

Use Python to explore the methods available to the Solution class.

#7. plotting_queries2.py

Introduces pivoting out by object name and plotting multiple series on the
same chart.
